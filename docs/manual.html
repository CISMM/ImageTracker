				<p>ImageTracker is an application designed to track and measure motion
				in image sequences. Videos often contain motion of several types, and
				analysis of these motions can be difficult. For example, videos of
				cells dividing show the cell moving within solution, kinetochores moving
				back and forth accross the cell equator, and microtubule structures
				migrating from the equator to the poles. ImageTracker allows for analysis
				of this type of motion through a multi-scale approach. The video is first
				stabilized with respect to global motion; flow analysis of smaller scale
				structures follows.</p>
				<p>ImageTracker was written to analyze microscopy videos. Several challenges
				in analyzing microscopy video means ImageTracker's performance will
				depend partially on the nature of the video being analyzed.  In particular,
				performance may suffer on videos that have low signal-to-noise ratio,
				poor feature resolution, sparse temporal sampling (objects move too
				much between fames), and short object life (features appear and disappear
				frequently).</p>

			  	<p>Remove previous versions of ImageTracker from your computer before
				installing updates. To uninstall ImageTracker, select Start--&gt;All
				Programs--&gt;NSRG--&gt;ImageTracker--&gt;Uninstall ImageTracker from
				the start menu. </p>
			  	<p>Note: ImageTracker is a stand-alone application at this time and does
				not require the NSRG Runtime. </p>
				<p>Download and execute the installer from \\nsrg-cs\installers; we
				recommend that you accept all default parameters in order to conform to NSRG
				standards. This will create a folder on your harddrive, C:\NSRG\bin\ImageTracker,
				and will add to your programs menu a folder NSRG\ImageTracker.</p>
		    	<p>Run ImageTracker by selecting Start--&gt;All Programs--&gt;NSRG--&gt;
				ImageTracker--&gt;ImageTracker. </p>
				<p>The main ImageTracker window is shown to the right. The window consists of
				a menu bar, main canvas, and a status bar. ImageTracker will launch new
				dialog windows for different purposes, for example, loading files and
				logging information. Most of these windows may be moved around the screen,
				risized, or temporarily hidden.</p>
				<p>Program information will be written to a Logger window at various points
				during execution. This information may be useful for making sure the application
				is still running, or debugging the application if something goes wrong. Click the
				Hide button on the Logger window to remove it from your desktop. You can recall
				it by selecting View--&gt;Logger from the ImageTracker menu.</p>

				<p>ImageTracker operates on sets of image files. Currently, ImageTracker
				does not support metamorph stacks or video files. Although ImageTracker
				technically can read PNG, TIFF, and JPEG image files, the best luck so
				far has been in reading 8-bit PNG images. Future releases may have support
				for a wider variety of image formats.</p>
				<p>Open a set of image files by selecting the menu item File--&gt;Open. This
				displays a dialog that allows to manage the set of active image files. Click
				on the "Add" button to bring up a directory browser. Navigate to the directory
				that contains your image files, and select the image files you would like to
				process.</p>
				<p>When the ImageTracker active files list is populated, selecting a file in
				this list will display the image in the main window. You may add or remove
				files from this list, but all active files must reside in the same directory.</p>
				<p>Clicking "OK" on the active files dialog hides the dialog, but does not clear
				the active files list. You can recall this list at any time by selecting
				Files--&gt;Open from the menu.</p>

				<p class="section"><a name="imagealignment">Image Alignment</a></p>
				<p>ImageTracker can stabilize video sequences with respect to certain types
				of motion through image alignment or registration. In this process an object
				of interest is identified by the user. ImageTracker will attempt to align all
				images in the sequence such that this object of interest appears in the same
				location across all frames. In this context, Alignment, Registration, and
				Stabilization are all terms that describe the same process.</p>
				<p>Launch the registration dialog by selecting Actions--&gt;Register from the
				ImageTracker menu. The alignment dialog consists of several sections:
				Thresholding, Smoothing, and Output.</p>
				<p>Thresholding and Smoothing alter input images so that alignment is easier
				to perform. If the preview checkbox on the registration dialog is selected,
				the first image in the active image list will appear in the ImageTracker
				main window with the appropriate pre-processing filters applied. Under certain
				situations, the preview checkbox may be checked but the image in the ImageTracker
				window is not properly updated. In this case, simply un-check and re-check the
				preview checkbox. (This may happen if you select an image in the active files
				dialog and then return to the registration dialog.)</p>

				<p class="subsection"><a name="thresholding">Thresholding</a></p>
				<p>Thresholding selects a range of pixel intensity values to use for
				registration. In many images, an object of interest will be of a certain
				intensity, and background objects will be of a different intensity.
				Selecting an appropriate threshold range will allow the registration
				process to operate only on the object(s) of interest. At right is an
				image of a cell that has been properly thresholded to select the mitotic
				spindle and exclude the cell membrane from the registration.</p>

				<p class="subsection"><a name="smoothing">Smoothing</a></p>
				<p>Smoothing an image improves image registration by removing small-scale
				features. Withouth smoothing, the registration process may get "caught" in
				local image details, and not find the best global alignment. The goal here
				is to adjust the degree of smoothing such that the object of interest
				appears as a cohesive image feature without many small-scale details. An
				example of an appropriately smoothed and thresholded mitotic spindle is
				shown to the right.</p>

				<p>The output image registration is a list of image transformations that
				describe how to align images in the sequence. The output section of the
				registration dialog allows you to select a text file in which to save
				this information. You may also choose to apply these transformations to
				the original images and save the registered image sequence. The Transforms
				and Images checkboxes at the bottom of the registration dialog indicate that
				you want to save these data.</p>
				<p>Select a transforms file by checking the transforms checkbox and clicking
				on the File button to select an output file. After selecting a transforms
				file, the directory in which to save registered images is set to the same
				directory. (Similarly, if you select an images output directory first, a
				default transforms file is selected for you.)</p>
				<p>If you are saving the transfomed image files, the prefix text box indicates
				the prefix you want to apply to all registered images. This prefix will be
				prepended to the original image file names. The image at right shows the
				registration dialog configured to save both transform data and transformed
				images.</p>

				<p>Once the thresholding, smoothing, and output sections of the registration
				dialog have been adjusted to your preferences, you are ready to perform the
				image registration. Clicking on the Next button at the bottom of the dialog
				will advance the image registration processor by one image pair. That is,
				ImageTracker will find the optimal transformation between the current and
				next image in the sequence. No data will be saved until the end of the
				image sequence is reached, but advancing in this manner for the first one
				or two images may help you determine if the prefiltering parameters are
				resonable or give you an indication of how long it will take to align
				all images in the sequence.</p>
				<p>Clicking the Run All button will register all images in the sequence
				and output the appropriate data at the end of registration. This may take a
				while...the Logger may provide some information during this process, but
				sometimes the registration process consumes all available resources, and
				the information will not be provided.</p>
