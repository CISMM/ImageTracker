				<p>ImageTracker is an application designed to track and measure motion
				in image sequences. Videos often contain motion of several types, and
				analysis of these motions can be difficult. For example, videos of
				cells dividing show the cell moving within solution, kinetochores moving
				back and forth accross the cell equator, and microtubule structures
				migrating from the equator to the poles. ImageTracker enables analysis
				of this type of motion through a multi-scale approach. The video is first
				stabilized with respect to global motion; flow analysis of smaller scale
				structures follows.</p>
				<p>ImageTracker was written to analyze microscopy videos. Several challenges
				in analyzing microscopy video mean ImageTracker's performance will
				depend partially on the nature of the video being analyzed.  In particular,
				performance may suffer on videos that have low signal-to-noise ratio,
				poor feature resolution, sparse temporal sampling (objects move too
				much between fames), and short object life (features appear and disappear
				frequently).</p>
				<p>The text of this guide refers to the Windows version of ImageTracker, but the screenshots are of the Linux version.  The major differences between these two platforms are purely aesthetic.</p>

				installing updates. To uninstall ImageTracker, select Start--&gt;All
				Programs--&gt;NSRG--&gt;ImageTracker--&gt;Uninstall ImageTracker from
				the start menu. </p>
			  	<p>Note: ImageTracker is a stand-alone application at this time and does
				not require the NSRG Runtime. </p>
				<p>Download and execute the installer from \\nsrg-cs\installers; we
				recommend that you accept all default parameters in order to conform to NSRG
				standards. This will create a folder on your harddrive, C:\NSRG\bin\ImageTracker,
				and will add to your programs menu a folder NSRG\ImageTracker.</p>
		    	<p>Run ImageTracker by selecting Start--&gt;All Programs--&gt;NSRG--&gt;
				ImageTracker--&gt;ImageTracker. </p>
				<p>The main ImageTracker window is shown to the right. The window consists of
				a menu bar, image panel, a data source panel, and logging panel. ImageTracker will launch new
				dialog windows for different purposes. Most of these windows may be moved around the screen,
				resized, or temporarily hidden.</p>
				<p>Program information will be written to the logging panel at various points
				during execution. This information may be useful for making sure the application
				is still running or troubleshooting the application if something goes wrong. You can change the levels of logging messages that appear from the menu Help--&gt;Logging. All messages at or above the selected logging level will be displayed. </p>			</td>

				<p>ImageTracker operates on sets of image files, called &quot;data sources&quot;.  Currently, ImageTracker does not support metamorph stacks, video files, or raw image files. Although ImageTracker technically can read PNG, TIFF, and JPEG image files, there have been some problems reading certain types of TIFF images. This should be remedied as of version 2.00. Future releases may have support for a wider variety of image formats.</p>
				<p>Open a set of image files by selecting the menu item File--&gt;Open or clicking on the &quot;+&quot; button on the image files panel. This launches the Edit Data Source dialog, and also opens a file browser. First, select the image files that constitute the data set. After closing the file selection dialog, configure the data source in the Edit Data Source Dialog. Choose a name for your data source (optional) and select the pixel data type. Add or remove files from the data source using the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; buttons.</p>
				<p>In the main ImageTracker window, the data source panel on the left displays which data sources are currently loaded. Images from each data source are drawn in the image display panel on the right. Images from all data sources are drawn simultaneously, so a recenlty-added data source might obscure an older data source.</p>
				<p>In ImageTracker, image processing tasks are performed on the data source that is selected in the ImageTracker main window. If no data source is selected, ImageTracker will assume that the first data source in the list should be used.</p>
				<p>To change the magnification of the current image, right click on the image, and drag the mouse up or down. To move the current image, center click on the image and drag the mouse in the desired direction. To rotate an image, left click on the image and drag the mouse. To change the index of the image displayed from each loaded data source, move the slider at the bottom of the image display panel.</p>

				<p>ImageTracker can stabilize video sequences with respect to certain types of motion through image alignment or registration. In this process an object of interest is identified by the user. ImageTracker will attempt to align all images in the sequence such that this object of interest appears in the same location across all frames. In this context, <em>alignment</em>, <em>registration</em>, and <em>stabilization</em> are all terms that describe the same process.</p>

			<p>Multiple resolution registration aligns images iteratively using a series of coarse to fine image resolution sclales. This method provides a dual advantage over single-scale resolution: it typically performs faster and is more robust to large initial displacements. The method relies on the user specifying an <em>image pyramid</em>, that defines a series of image resolutions. Registration is performed at each pyramid level starting at the most coarse; the result of each level's registration is propagated to the next level of the pyramid. </p>
			<p>Each lower resolution level of the image pyramid is generated by smoothing and rescaling the preceding image to half its width and height.</p>
			<p>Lauch the Multi-Resolution Registration dialog by selecting Enhance-&gt;Stabilizefrom the ImageTracker menu. The alignment dialog consists of several sections:  <em>thresholding</em>, <em>smoothing</em>, <em>optimization</em>, and <em>output</em>. Thresholding and Smoothing alter input images so that alignment is easier to perform. An altered sample image (the first in the data source) appears in ImageTracker's image display window.</p>

In many images, an object of interest will be of a certain intensity, and background objects will be of a different intensity. Selecting an appropriate threshold range enables the registration process to operate only on the object(s) of interest. Select upper and lower bounds for the threshold using the Upper and Lower Bound sliders.  Use the Range choice box to select an appropriate range for the sliders: 8-bit uses values 0&ndash;255, 16-bit uses values 0&ndash;65535, and From Image uses the minimum and maximum intensity values from the sample image.</p>

			<p>The image pyramids used in the multiple resolution registration method are generated using a maximum and minimum smoothing factor.  Adjust the Maximum and Minimum Smoothing sliders to change these parameters.  ImageTracker will automatically choose appropriate intermediate image pyramid resolutions. The smoothing factors specify the scaling to apply to an image; e.g. a factor of 2 shrinks an image by half its width and height; a factor of 8 creates an image 1/8 th the size of the original in each dimension. Note that changing the smoothing factor changes the smoothing applied to the preview image, but does not change the size of the preview image. During registration, the images are rescaled appropriately.</p>
			<p>The goal in adjusting the smoothing factors is to smooth enough of the &quot;uninteresting&quot; parts of the target object such that a good stabilization can easily be found. Adjust the maximum smoothing to completely blur all the details away from the preview image. Adjust the minimum smoothing to blur any noise present in the image as well as any small-scale features that are not of interest in the image alignment. It is best to exclude from registration scales at which noise will contribute significantly to the registration.</p>

			<p>A lot of factors can contribute to microscopy images that are not optically optimal. Once such case is when objects that are spurious to the experiment end up in the optical path&mdash;this can be dust on the image sensor or coverslip, or it can be part of the specimen that is close enough to the focal plane (slab, really) to appear in the final image. ImageTracker's occlusion removal may be able to remove <em>fixed</em> elements from <em>bright-field</em> micrsocopy videos in which the features of interest are moving. This method depends on the specimen moving and on the fixed occlusions transmitting a portion of the microscope's illumination.</p>
			<p>Select Enhance-&gt;Remove Occlusions to show the Remove Partial Occlusions dialog. The following parameters specify how occlusion removal will be attempted:</p>
			<dl>
			<dt>Metric</dt>
			<dd>Specifies the computation that will be used to estimate the constant amount of light absorbed at each image location. The Mean metric is faster, but the Median metric perfoms better if there are slow moving objects in the specimen.</dd>
			<dt>Max Transmission</dt>
			<dd>This setting adjusts the overall brightness of the final images. Select 100 to only increase the brightness of the image everywhere. Select 50 to maintain the average intensity between the input and output images. Note that some intensity values of the output images may become clipped to the maximum allowable output level. If this happens (the resulting images will looked washed out or saturated), decrease the value of this slider.</dd>
			<dt>Fourier Padding</dt>
			<dd>This slider corresponds to a windowing applied to images when using the Median transmission metric. The default value of 0.5 will use a window of half the image size on each boundary when computing Fourier transforms. This value is perfectly reasonable for most cases, and probably does not need to be changed.</dd>
			<dt>Output Directory</dt>
			<dd>Specifies the directory in which to put output images.</dd>
			<dt>Transmission Map</dt>
			<dd>This is an image file that will hold the computed constant transmission factor at every location on the image plane. ImageTracker can open this type of image (it has floating point pixels), which can be useful to see where ImageTracker found occluding regions.

In the case of 2D motion where the image plane is parallel to the motion plane, optic flow is a good estimate of real-world motion. This scenario is common in microscopy.</p>
			<p>Flow computation results in a vector image in which each pixel vector represents the computed velocity in the image's x and y directions. Visualization of these images is described in a later section.</p>

Follow the instructions from Kitware on how to install and run ParaView. The following  will help you create a visualization of flow fields with ParaView.</p>
  	        <p>Select File--&gt;Open Data from the ParaView menu. Navigate to and select the flow field file(s) created by ImageTracker (.mha extension). The default visualization for vector image data is a scalar field of vector magnitude intensities. We will create arrow glyphs that will represent the magnitude and direction of the flow field.</p>
		<p>Becaues of a disconnect between image and data origin conventions, flow fields computed in ImageTracker are flipped in ParaView. To correct this, choose Filter-&gt;Reflection from the ParaView menu. Configure the reflection filter as follows: Plane = Y; Center = image height-1; Copy Input off. After clicking accept, the flow field image will flip.</p>
  	        <p>Click on the Calculator icon on the ParaView tool bar, or select Filter--&gt;Calculator from the menu. Use the buttons on the calculator parameters tab to create the following expression:</p>
  	        <p><code>-iHat*ImageFile_0+jHat*ImageFile_1</code></p>
  	        <p>The ImageFile_x expressions are available under the scalars dropdown box. This expression computes a vector in ParaView from the scalar components stored in the image file. (Note that the negative sign in front of the x-axis expression represents a convention change from that used in ImageTracker.) Once the expression is entered, press the Accept button.</p>
  	        <p>Select Filter--&gt;Glyph from the menu. ParaView will automatically select a vector scale factor appropriate to make the glyphs visible. Press the Accept button. </p>
  	        <p>The default colormap in ParaView is a blue-to-red rainbow color scale. To change this, select the Display tab from the Glyph property control, and then press the Edit Color Map button. Click on the preset colormap button (beneath the lock icon), and select either Greyscale or CIELab Blue to Red. These colormaps may be easier to use to interpret vector data. </p>
  	        <p>It may be helpful to view the original image data along with the vector flow fields. To do this, turn off the visualization of the Calculator filter (the arrow glyphs should remain). Select File--&gt;Open Data from the menu, and select the original image file(s). Note that Paraview does not support TIFF images, so you may have to convert files to a supported format, such as PNG. You may also want to adjust the maximum number of glyphs to display, or their scale factor. The image at the right shows a visualization of mucus flow using the steps thus far. </p>  	        </td>

			<p>The method described above works well for dense flow fields, such as those created using the CLG Optical Flow method. Sparse fields, such as those created by Feature Tracking, may not contain enough data to effectively represent the image motion without displaying a very large number of vector glyphs. An alternative is to crop the flow field data to restrict the region of interest.</p>	  	      <p>Select the input vector image source from the Selection Window, and select Filter--&gt;Crop from the  menu. Adjust the exten to crop using the Parameters tab. Click the Accept button when the crop region corresponds with the desired region of interest.</p>
			<p>Select the Calculator filter object, and change its input to ImageClip1. This will change the region over which vector data is calculated and displayed. You may wish to adjust the glyph filter's parameters to increase the number of glyphs displayed or change the scaling factor. The images at the right show the results of cropping the sparse fields generated by feature tracking. </p>			</td>
