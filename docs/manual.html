				<p>ImageTracker is an application designed to track and measure motion
				in image sequences. Videos often contain motion of several types, and
				analysis of these motions can be difficult. For example, videos of
				cells dividing show the cell moving within solution, kinetochores moving
				back and forth accross the cell equator, and microtubule structures
				migrating from the equator to the poles. ImageTracker allows for analysis
				of this type of motion through a multi-scale approach. The video is first
				stabilized with respect to global motion; flow analysis of smaller scale
				structures follows.</p>
				<p>ImageTracker was written to analyze microscopy videos. Several challenges
				in analyzing microscopy video means ImageTracker's performance will
				depend partially on the nature of the video being analyzed.  In particular,
				performance may suffer on videos that have low signal-to-noise ratio,
				poor feature resolution, sparse temporal sampling (objects move too
				much between fames), and short object life (features appear and disappear
				frequently).</p>

				the start menu. </p>
			  	<p>Note: ImageTracker is a stand-alone application at this time and does
				not require the NSRG Runtime. </p>
				<p>Download and execute the installer from \\nsrg-cs\installers; we
				recommend that you accept all default parameters in order to conform to NSRG
				standards. This will create a folder on your harddrive, C:\NSRG\bin\ImageTracker,
				and will add to your programs menu a folder NSRG\ImageTracker.</p>
		    	<p>Run ImageTracker by selecting Start--&gt;All Programs--&gt;NSRG--&gt;
				ImageTracker--&gt;ImageTracker. </p>
				<p>The main ImageTracker window is shown to the right. The window consists of
				a menu bar, main canvas, and a status bar. ImageTracker will launch new
				dialog windows for different purposes, for example, loading files and
				logging information. Most of these windows may be moved around the screen,
				risized, or temporarily hidden.</p>
				<p>Program information will be written to a Logger window at various points
				during execution. This information may be useful for making sure the application
				is still running, or debugging the application if something goes wrong. Click the
				Hide button on the Logger window to remove it from your desktop. You can recall
				it by selecting View--&gt;Logger from the ImageTracker menu.</p>

				<p>ImageTracker operates on sets of image files. Currently, ImageTracker
				does not support metamorph stacks or video files. Although ImageTracker
				technically can read PNG, TIFF, and JPEG image files, the best luck so
				far has been in reading 8-bit PNG images. Future releases may have support
				for a wider variety of image formats.</p>
				<p>Open a set of image files by selecting the menu item File--&gt;Open. This
				displays a dialog that allows to manage the set of active image files. Click
				on the "Add" button to bring up a directory browser. Navigate to the directory
				that contains your image files, and select the image files you would like to
				process.</p>
				<p>When the ImageTracker active files list is populated, selecting a file in
				this list will display the image in the main window. You may add or remove
				files from this list, but all active files must reside in the same directory.</p>
				<p>Clicking "OK" on the active files dialog hides the dialog, but does not clear
				the active files list. You can recall this list at any time by selecting

				<p>ImageTracker can stabilize video sequences with respect to certain types
				of motion through image alignment or registration. In this process an object
				of interest is identified by the user. ImageTracker will attempt to align all
				images in the sequence such that this object of interest appears in the same
				location across all frames. In this context, Alignment, Registration, and
				Stabilization are all terms that describe the same process.</p>
				<p>Launch the registration dialog by selecting Actions--&gt;Register from the
				ImageTracker menu. The alignment dialog consists of several sections:
				Thresholding, Smoothing, and Output.</p>
				<p>Thresholding and Smoothing alter input images so that alignment is easier
				to perform. If the preview checkbox on the registration dialog is selected,
				the first image in the active image list will appear in the ImageTracker
				main window with the appropriate pre-processing filters applied. Under certain
				situations, the preview checkbox may be checked but the image in the ImageTracker
				window is not properly updated. In this case, simply un-check and re-check the
				preview checkbox. (This may happen if you select an image in the active files
				dialog and then return to the registration dialog.)</p>

  	        <p>ImageTracker provides several methods to determine the image flow from an image sequence. Optic flow is an estimation of real-world motion projected onto the image plane. In the case of 2D motion where the image plane is parallel to the motion plane, optic flow is a good estimate of real-world motion. This scenario is common in microscopy.</p>
  	        <p>To access the optic flow computation methods, select Actions--&gt;Optic Flow from the ImageTracker menu. The options are:</p>
  	        <dl>
  	          <dt>Track Features</dt>
  	          <dd>Find features of interest within an image and track each of these features across the video sequence; this is good for images that have well-defined features and for motion that may not be spatially smooth</dd>
  	          <dt>Combined Local Global</dt>
  	          <dd>Use an iterative algorithm to compute flow estimates at every location in the image; this is good for image sequences containing coherent flow</dd>
  	          </dl>
  	        <p>Each of these options are described in more detail in the following sections.</p>

  	        <p>Feature-based tracking attempts to compute motion in images by matching image regions (features) across multiple images. Essential to this technique is the ability to find strong image features&#8212;good features to track are image patches that are high in texture content (the local image area has a large gradient in more than one direction). Once image features are detected in an initial image, corresponding features are found in the next image in the sequence through  local registration.</p>
  	        <p>The feature tracker dialog allows the user to configure the following parameters:</p>
  	        <dl>
  	          <dt>Max Count</dt>
  	          <dd>The number of feaures to find; this influences the density of the resulting flow image</dd>
  	          <dt>Scale</dt>
  	          <dd>Indicates the size (in pixels) of image features; adjust this to the approximate size of the features of interest in the image</dd>
  	          <dt>Max Distance</dt>
  	          <dd>The maximum distance (in pixels) that a feature might move between frames; this defines the image patch search area during the local registration step</dd>

			<p>The implementation provided in ImageTracker is the single-resolution, simple temporal difference variant. The  algorithm is to iteratively estimates optical flow by minimizing an engergy functional that includes a local intensity constancy term (the Lucas/Kanade part) and a global smoothness term (the Horn/Schunck part). </p>
			<p>The following parameters on the CLG Optic Flow dialog control the operation of the algorithm:</p>

			  <dd>The spatial smoothing applied to the input images during derivative computation; adjust this to the noise level present in the images</dd>
			  <dt>Regularization</dt>
			  <dd>Adjusts the constant scaling of the smoothness term in the energy functional; a larger number will result in smoother flow fields, a smaller number will allow more turbulent flow fields</dd>
			  <dt>Relaxation</dt>
			  <dd>The constant to use during the successive over-relaxation (SOR) step of the algorithm; this affects the speed of the iterative algorithm&#8212;Bruhn et al suggest a value in the range 1.90-1.99</dd>

Follow the instructions from Kitware on how to install and run ParaView. The following  will help you create a visualization of flow fields with ParaView.</p>
  	        <p>Select File--&gt;Open Data from the ParaView menu. Navigate to and select the flow field file(s) created by ImageTracker (.mha extension). The default visualization for vector image data is a scalar field of vector magnitude intensities. We will create arrow glyphs that will represent the magnitude and direction of the flow field. </p>
  	        <p>Click on the Calculator icon on the ParaView tool bar, or select Filter--&gt;Calculator from the menu. Use the buttons on the calculator parameters tab to create the following expression:</p>
  	        <p>-iHat*ImageFile_0+jHat*ImageFile_1</p>
  	        <p>The ImageFile_x expressions are available under the scalars dropdown box. This expression computes a vector in ParaView from the scalar components stored in the image file. (Note that the negative sign in front of the x-axis expression represents a convention change from that used in ImageTracker.) Once the expression is entered, press the Accept button.</p>
  	        <p>Select Filter--&gt;Glyph from the menu. ParaView will automatically select a vector scale factor appropriate to make the glyphs visible. Press the Accept button. </p>
  	        <p>The default colormap in ParaView is a blue-to-red rainbow color scale. To change this, select the Display tab from the Glyph property control, and then press the Edit Color Map button. Click on the preset colormap button (beneath the lock icon), and select either Greyscale or CIELab Blue to Red. These colormaps may be easier to use to interpret vector data. </p>
  	        <p>It may be helpful to view the original image data along with the vector flow fields. To do this, turn off the visualization of the Calculator filter (the arrow glyphs should remain). Select File--&gt;Open Data from the menu, and select the original image file(s). Note that Paraview does not support TIFF images, so you may have to convert files to a supported format, such as PNG. You may also want to adjust the maximum number of glyphs to display, or their scale factor. The image at the right shows a visualization of mucus flow using the steps thus far. </p>  	        </td>
